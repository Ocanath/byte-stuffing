	Takes a payload and stuffs it based on PPP byte stuffing protocol. 
	Result is available in a global fixed stuffing buffer
	
	Returns the size of the stuffed buffer on success
	If there is a memory overrun, returns 0 to indicate failure
	
	Inputs:
		payload: buffer containing the data to be byte stuffed
		payload_size: the length of the data payload
		stuffed_buffer_size: the length of the working buffer. For bounds check/preventing memory overrun of the working buffer
	Outputs:
		stuffed_buffer: the working buffer containing the stuffed result
		returns: the length of the stuffed buffer, or 0 if the stuffed buffer is overrun

	Note: This will cause a memory overrun if the size of the payload is less than half the stuffed buffer size + 2
	This is the reciprocal function of stuff_pkt
	
	Inputs: 
		stuffed_buffer: the payload, which has been stuffed
		stuffed_buffer_length: the length of the stuffed data. 
			Must be less than the actual bounds of the stuffed buffer, 
			but the function may return without scanning up to this range.
			Function will return after the first valid payload frame detected in the stuffed buffer
		payload_size: the upper bound on the size of the working buffer, payload. prevents memory overrun. Can be larger than the actual payload size, which is a returned value
		
	Outputs:
		payload: the working buffer. contains resulting unstuffed data after function returns successfully
		returns: the actual size of the payload, after unstuffing operation is complete. returns 0 on failure




	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	DON'T TRUST THIS FUNCTION. When I switched to buffer_t, 
	I used ->length instead of *bidx for stream index tracking and 
	i'm not sure that works correctly.

	This function requires explicit unit testing. Once I add it i'll delte this comment.
	TODO: what you have to do to clear this comment.
